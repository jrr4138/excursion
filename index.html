            It is my strong belief that Jar Jar Binks is the cause to all of the destruction that led to the Empire. Jar Jar was remembered to be a comic relief character
            that George Lucas designed to be clumbsy, foolish, and quite frankly, lucky. But with this comic relief character comes a great burden that not many fans have
            probably realized.

                When we first meet Jar Jar Binks, he is a babbling bafoon on the planet of Naboo. He is found by two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn who were on a mission
                to settle the trade dispute between the Trade Federation and Naboo that threatened Naboolians. From there, because the Gungans are a moderately sized minority alien species
                newly found out about by the Naboo people, they required a Representative in the senate. Since the Gungans did not enjoy Jar Jar's company (brought humans to their secret
                underwater city), but the Gungans also didn't like interacting with Humans, they
            </p>
            <p>
                decided that Jar Jar would be the perfect Representative for their people. The newly promoted Representative for the Gungans, Binks joureys to Coruscant where the Galactic
                Senate is located. From here he works closely with Senator Amedala to add new light to how the Gungan people would feel about any changes or discussions that are brought
                to the attention of the Senate. Now we know that Jar Jar Binks has a low ranking authority in the Senate, he can push for ideas and changes that will benefit others.
                With this power, he is able to unknowingly alter the course of history as the galaxy would know it...

            While being a Representative, Jar Jar's most notable act was to give the Surpreme Chancellor emergency powers to help stop the growing threat of the Trade Federation's
            massive droid army. Representative Binks said, "In response to this direct threat to the Republic, mesa propose that the Senate give immediately cmergency powers to
            the Supreme Chancellor." With this one simply decree by Representative Binks, he started a chain reaction that led to the end of the Republic and the beginning of the
            reign of terror that was the Empire.

            From this innocent act of trying to act quickly to fix a problem, Jar Jar gave the hidden Sith Lord the power to instate the Grand Army of the Republic that was comprised of clones.
            The new army was sent to Geonosis to fight the droids army, and from this battle, the Clone Wars was started. During the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine obtained control of the courts,
            the banks, the army, and many more high-priority aspects of the Senate. The Clone Wars threw the Jedi into a long confusion and distrust of the Senate from what the Chancellor was doing,
            created a greater divide between the Seperatists and the Republic, and had members of the Senate worried and dependent on the Chancellor. This dependence allowed for the Chancellor to
            almost do as he pleased, because they were almost fully supporting of his decisions. With all of this control, he became more powerful than anyone had ever planned for. He never gave up his power,
            overthrew the Jedi, labeled them as "Enemies of the Republic" and hunted them down. He reorganized the Republic into the first Galactic Empire, which he ruled for 23 years until he died
            a tragic death at the Battle of Endor. Under the Empire's rule, civilizations struggled and the galaxy lived in fear. All of these events were made possible by Jar Jar Bink's suggestion
            to give the Chancellor emergency powers because everyone was scared of the Seperatists and the Trade Federation's droid army. Jar Jar is to blame for the terror that horrified the galaxy
            for many years.
